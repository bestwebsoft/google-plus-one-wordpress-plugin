== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the button become red after clicking? =

For correct work of the Google +1 buttons do not use it locally and on a free hosting

= How to adjust Google +1 Button position on the page =

In WordPress admin panel, please go to "BWS Panel", find the Google +1 settings page and choose one of the listed positions: Before, After, Before and After. Then click "Save Changes".

= How to add Google +1 Button using the shortcode? =

Just paste code [bws_googleplusone] into the necessary page, post or text widget for adding Google +1 Button or use a "display" parameter for adding another button(s).
For example: [bws_googleplusone display="plusone,share,follow,hangout,badge"]. You can change the buttons queue in "display" parameter as you want.

= Why I don't see the Follow Button and Google Badge? =

Follow Button and Google Badge don`t work without Google ID. Just enter it on Settings Page
