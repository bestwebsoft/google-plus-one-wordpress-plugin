== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to add Google +1 Button using the shortcode? =

Just paste code [bws_googleplusone] into the necessary page, post or text widget for adding Google +1 Button or use a "display" parameter for adding another button(s).

For example:
[bws_googleplusone display="plusone,share,follow,hangout,badge"]. You can change the buttons queue in "display" parameter as you want.

= I want to change the position of plugin buttons on the page =

In WordPress admin panel, please go to “Google +1” page and choose one of the listed positions: Before, After. Then click “Save Changes”.

= I click the button and it turns red. Why? =

For correct work of the Google +1 buttons do not use it locally and on a free hosting.

= Why I don't see the Follow Button and Google Badge? =

Follow Button and Google Badge don`t work without Google ID. Just enter it on Settings Page.

= I've entered Google ID, but nothing has changed. Why? =

Please check the Badge type. Google Badge works incorrectly if Google ID don`t match with the Badge Type.
